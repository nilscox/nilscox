### Hi there 👋

I'm Nils, yet another developer.

I'm currently working for Gojob, a french employment agency based in Aix-en-Provence. I love coding 💻, drinking beers 🍻, my cats 😻, practice my slackline skills 🌲➖🌳, making electronic music 🎵, and coding 🤓 (yes, I really love coding, especially in TypeScript).

Feel free to [get in touch](mailto:nilscox.dev@gmail.com) 😉
